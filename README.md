      <div class="fakeimg" style="height:100px;">Image</div>
      <p>My name's Debbie, I'm a stay at home Mum to one child. I live with my fiance, our daughter and our cat and my cooking skills are very poor.</p>
      <p>In the past when I have attempted cooking I've either guessed ingredients or tried to cook too fast; this cooking fails have resulted in:<br>
*food poisioning from a frozen chicken pizza because I turned the temperature up high and tried to cook it in less time<br>
*potato wedges that were favoured with cinnamon instead of cajun because I couldn't remember which spice to use but knew it began with "c"<br>
*the strangest brownie ever as I ended up attempting to grill it, resulting in the bottom undercooked, the middle perfect, and the top burnt</p>
      <p>Now that we have a daughter and I'm a stay at home Mum I'm determined to improve my cooking skills, as well as keeping on top of housework, cleaning and keeping up with playdates.</p>

      <h2>Prawn Curry in a Hurry</h2>
      <h5>The first cooking attempt. Monday 6th January 2020.</h5>
      <div class="fakeimg" style="height:200px;">Image</div>
      <p>For my first attempt at cooking I decided to try and do something we had all the ingredients in for, we mostly did for this, we were just missing the curry paste.</p>
      <p>Apparently the recipe is listed as easy and prep is only 5 minutes, cooking time is only 10 minutes, this assumes though that you don't need to take into considersation anything else, such as rice or naan bread to have with the curry (you definety need something else, this is not filling enough on it's own). So I did it with rice and found it to take about 20 minutes. Also if like me you have frozen prawns you need to make sure you remember to defrost the prawns in time otherwise you'll need to do it another day.</p>
      <p>The review I got from my fiance was very positive, he really enjoyed it but wanted it a bit spicier for him in the future, I actually cooked this a few days later because it was so nice for us both and achieved the extra spiciness for him by keeping him portion of curry in the wok and adding an extra half a teaspoon of curry paste. A friend came round for the second attempt and both praised dinner so I will be using this as a nice fall back.</p>
      <p>
      <p>
Ingredients
<br>2 tbsp curry paste
<br>1 onion finely sliced 
<br>200g large raw or cooked prawns (defrosted if frozen)
<br>400g can chopped tomato with garlic
<br>large bunch coriander, leaves and stalks chopped</p>

<p>Method
<br>Drizzle some oil from the curry paste jar into a wok or large frying pan, gently heat, then add the onion. 
<br>Sizzle over a low heat for 4 mins until the onion softens, then stir in the paste and cook for a few mins longer. 
<br>Stir in the prawns and tomatoes, then bring to a simmer. If using raw prawns, simmer until they have changed colour and are cooked through.
<br>Season, if you like, then add the coriander just before serving with boiled rice and naan bread.</p>
